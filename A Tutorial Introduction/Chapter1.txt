1.1 GETTING STARTED

We need to compile the .c program so we can run it. In linux:

  $ gcc program.c -o program
  $ ./program

- A C program consists of functions and variables.
- The program begins executing at the beginning of the main function


  #include <stdio.h>

- Tells the compiler to include information about the standard input-output library.

1.2 VARIABLES AND ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS

- We use /**/ to write comments
- All C variables must be declared before they are used. It has its properties, with their type:

  int fahr, celsius;

  int: integer
  float: floating point
  char: character - a single byte
  short: short integer
  long: long integer
  double: double-precision floating point

- We can create a loop with the while statement:

  while (fahr <= upper) {
  	...
  }

- The condition in parentheses is tested. If true, the body of the loop is executed. Then it is retested until the condition becomes False.
- If the while has only a single statement, then the braces are unecessary. The statement needs to be indented:

  while (i < j)
  	i = 2 * i;

- To print variables inside a string, we use this:

  printf("%d", i); /*%d specifies an integer argument*/

- If we wanted to print a floating point number:

  printf(""%3.1f", i) /*at least three characters wide, with one digit after the decimal point
